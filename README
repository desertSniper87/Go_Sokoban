This project implements the common game sokoban with Go.
There is no GUI, but only text output and input.

What is needed?
1. golang -> language with compiler
http://golang.org/doc/install.html
2. optional: godag -> dynamic,advanced compiler
http://code.google.com/p/godag/
3. optional: gedit plugin
http://go-lang.cat-v.org/text-editors/gedit/

How can you run it?
compile with godag in project folder: gd -o sokoban
run: ./sokoban [-l <levelfile>] [-r] [-m] [-i]
-r to directly run the algorithm
-m for finding more than one solution
-i for information
order of parameters does not matter
