This project implements the common game sokoban with Go.
There is no GUI, but only text output and input.

What is needed?
new: with PPA: 
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:gophers/go
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install golang

manual:
1. golang -> language with compiler
http://golang.org/doc/install.html
2. optional: godag -> dynamic,advanced compiler
http://code.google.com/p/godag/
3. optional: gedit plugin
http://go-lang.cat-v.org/text-editors/gedit/

How can you run it?
with PPA and go-runnable:
copy repo to $GOPATH/src/ (export GOPATH, if it does not exist)
compile: ~> go install sokoban/game
run: ~> game

the old way:
compile with godag in project folder: gd -o sokoban
run: ./sokoban [-r] [-m] [-i] [-s] [-l <levelfile>] [-f <outputFrequency>] [-d <debuglevel>] [-p]
-r to directly run the algorithm
-m for finding more than one solution
-i for information
-s for straightAhead
-l for levelfile
-f for outputFrequency
-d for debuglevel
-p for printing Surface regularly
the order of parameters does not matter
